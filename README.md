# Modified-Arch-install-script
It's my first script. It's horribly written, and most of itself is comprised from fixes from "stackoverflow". It's my first attempt to get off being a script kiddie.
This script is made to be deployed by myself whenever I want to quickly install arch, and possibly most of the programs I use. It includes things apart from the basic install like setting up yay.
